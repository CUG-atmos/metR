\title{Read NetCDF files.}
\usage{
ReadNetCDF(file, vars = NULL, out = c("data.frame", "vector", "array"),
  subset = NULL, key = FALSE)

GlanceNetCDF(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{file to read from.}

\item{vars}{a character vector with the name of the variables to read. If
\code{NULL}, then it read all the variables.}

\item{out}{character indicating the type of output desired}

\item{subset}{a named list a subsetting vectors. See Details.}

\item{key}{if \code{TRUE}, returns a data.table keyed by the dimensions of the data.}
}
\value{
The return format is specified by \code{out}. It can be a data table in which each
column is a variable and each row, an observation; an array with named
dimensions; or a vector. Since it's possible to return multiple arrays or
vectors (one for each variable), for consistency the return type is always a
list. Either of these two options are much faster than the
first since the most time consuming part is the melting of the array
returned by \link[ncdf4:ncvar_get]{ncdf4::ncvar_get}. \code{out = "vector"} is particularly useful for
adding new variables to an existing data frame with the same dimensions.

When not all variables specified in \code{vars} have the same number of dimensions,
the shorter variables will be recycled. E.g. if reading a 3D pressure field
and a 2D surface temperature field, the latter will be turned into a 3D field
with the same values in each missing dimension.

\code{GlanceNetCDF()} returns a list of variables and dimensions included in the
file with a nice printing method.
}
\description{
Using the \code{\link[ncdf4]{ncdf4-package}} package, it reads a NetCDF file. The advantage
over using \code{\link[ncdf4]{ncvar_get}} is that the output is a tidy data.table
with proper dimensions.
}
\details{
\code{subset} must be a named list for subsetting. Names must match dimensions
specified in the NetCDF file and each element must be a vector of the same type
of that dimension whose range will be use for subsetting. You don't need to
provide and exact range that matches the actual gridpoints of the file; the
closest gridpoint will be selected.

\examples{
\dontrun{
file <- "file.nc"
# Get a list of variables.
variables <- GlanceNetCDF(file)
print(variables)

# Read only the first one, with name "var".
field <- ReadNetCDF(file, vars = c(var = names(variables$vars[1])))
# Add a new variable.
# Â¡Make sure it's on the same exact grid!
field[, var2 := ReadNerCDF(file2, out = "vector", subset = list(lat = 90:10))]
}
